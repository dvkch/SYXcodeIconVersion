Xcode Icon Version
=======

Tired of this Xcode icon always showing multiple times in your App Switch with no help watshoever as to which version you are currently using? Well, no more !


Deprecated
==========

Since Xcode 8 and its new extension system + code signing this plugin stopped working and I don't plan on fixing it :) 

Read the code, share it, update it, fork it, it's all yours now. 

Don't open an issue asking how to repair it, there are some blog posts on how to disable Xcode codesigning and reenable plugin managers like Alcatraz.

How does it look?
====

Here is the app switcher with four different versions of Xcode running

And here is your Dock

How can I get it?
=======

It can either be done via [Alcatraz](http://alcatraz.io/) or by downloading the [GitHub project](https://github.com/dvkch/SYXcodeIconVersion/archive/master.zip) and building `SYXcodeIconVersion.xcodeproj` in Xcode, which will automagically install the plugin.

Use it as you like, don't blame me if your Macbook never restarts, and share with your friends,
